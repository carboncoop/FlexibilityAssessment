<h1>Material for the community organisation as an ‘aggregator</h1>

<h2>ECAS: Our Community Aggregator</h2>
<p>Power companies want to work with big chunks of flexibility in use of electricity to make it worth their effort. So far, most Flexibility Agreements are with big businesses and factories. As they start to work with householders, they want to make the contracts through 'aggregators'. Aggregators are organisations that bring lots of little energy users together and make a deal on their behalf./</p>
<p>So far it's mainly energy suppliers and heating appliance companies that are looking to become aggregators. We would like to set up ECAS as a cooperative, open-source aggregator, that lets community groups across the UK come together into a force large enough to deal directly with the power companies and grid operators. </p>

                <p>Many of the new grid problems are very area-specific, meaning that aggregators will need to recruit a big group of people in a small area. UK-wide, commercial aggregators will struggle to recruit large numbers of people in small areas using traditional marketing and advertising campaigns. </p>
                <p>It is local community groups, with local knowledge and local contacts, who are best placed to mobilise the numbers at this scale. </p>
                <p>Also, community organisations are energy consumers as well and could look at options for signing up for offering flexibility too – including options for putting any energy your community centre might be able to generate or store. </p>

                <p>We believe in the democratisation of our energy system and that infrastructure (such as an aggregation platform) should be locally owned and locally accountable. The value of local flexibility should stay within the community and with householders rather than benefiting the shareholders of large companies. Our energy use data should be in the hands of people we trust. </p>
                <p>The transformation of our energy system is a vital part of creating a more sustainable society and combatting climate change. It is also a moment of change, risk, and opportunity. We believe that the best way to ensure that these changes promote real social and environmental justice is by taking part in, and taking ownership over, the transformation. </p>

                <p>Community groups and their members could benefit in the following ways from taking part in Flexibility Agreements</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Strengthen community groups:</b> taking part in aggregating local flexibility could earn your community organisation a modest income, and the paid staff time that your group would gain through facilitating Flexibility aggregation could help support your other work and strengthen your presence in the community .</li>
                    <li><b>Help combat local fuel poverty:</b> the new income from Flexibility could help electrically heated householders offset their monthly bills.</li>
                    <li><b>Support wider community energy projects:</b> Flexibility Agreements can be a first step towards a larger community energy project, or complement existing projects. For example, the smart controllers could also be used to set up direct local energy supply from a community owned generator.</li>

                <p>As an aggregation organisation you will also need to be able to see how the flexibility being offered by individual households (as indicated by their individual reports above) adds up or 'aggregates' into larger amounts of flexibility for offering to the grid management companies.</p>
                <p>You can access an 'aggregation report' from the organisation's 
                    dashboard clicking the "Aggregation" tab. From there you can 
                    filter the list of assessments and/or tick the check boxes to 
                    choose which assessments use for the report.</p>
                <p>The information shown in the report is:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Number of assessments in report</li>
                    <li>Flexible power available (kW)</li>
                    <li>Total load shifted (kWh/year)</li>
                    <li>A table indicating the total income that each one of the 
                        3 schemes (Secure, Dynamic and Restore) would generate. 
                        More information about these schemes can be found in the 
                        household report</li>
                    <li>You are also able to calculate the income for a bespoke 
                        scheme by tweaking the different factors that the model 
                        uses</li>
                </ul>
